# AI Usage Declaration

**Course:** Advanced Programming 2025  
**Institution:** HEC Lausanne  
**Project:** Earnings Post-Announcement Excess Return Prediction

## AI Tool Used

**Windsurf IDE with Cascade AI Assistant** (Claude 4.5, Anthropic)  
Used throughout project development for code generation, debugging, and documentation.

---

## How AI Was Used

### Code Implementation
- Generated modular pipeline structure (20 steps)
- Implemented data processing (Steps 1-10)
- Created ML models (Steps 11-13)
- Generated unit tests and documentation

### Human Responsibilities
- Defined all research questions and hypotheses
- Made all methodological decisions
- Validated all code and outputs
- Interpreted results and drew conclusions

---

## What AI Did NOT Do

**All intellectual work remained human-controlled:**

1. **Research Design:** Hypothesis (H₀), research question, 30-day window choice
2. **Methodology:** Feature selection, model selection, evaluation metrics
3. **Analysis:** Interpretation of R² ≈ 0, conclusions about market efficiency
4. **Critical Thinking:** Understanding why models fail, implications for EMH

## Academic Integrity

This project follows HEC Lausanne's integrity policies:

- **Transparency:** All AI usage documented
- **Human Control:** Research design and analysis are original work
- **Validation:** All AI outputs reviewed and tested
- **Learning:** Student understands all implemented concepts

**Key Principle:** AI implemented ideas; human provided the ideas and understanding.

## Benefits & Limitations

**Benefits:**
- Faster implementation of well-defined tasks
- Consistent code quality and documentation
- More time for research design and analysis

**Limitations:**
- Required constant human validation
- Occasional errors in complex logic
- Need for iterative refinement
